## Boggle Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic word search game Boggle! It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing you to enjoy a visually appealing and interactive Boggle experience.

**Features:**

* **Randomly generated boards:** Each game features a new board with unique letter combinations, keeping things fresh!
* **Time pressure:** A timer counts down the game duration, adding an element of urgency and pushing you to find as many words as possible.
* **Interactive word search:** Click on letter buttons to form words on the board. 
* **Smart scoring:** Points are awarded based on the length of the discovered word, rewarding longer and more challenging finds.
* **Valid words only:** The game only accepts valid words from a provided dictionary, preventing nonsensical entries. 
* **No double dipping:** You can't use the same word twice during the game, ensuring a diverse vocabulary hunt.
* **Track your progress:** A "Found words:" list keeps track of the words you've already found, helping you avoid getting lost in the letter maze.
* **Visually engaging GUI:** Enjoy a clear layout with buttons, labels, and informative messages that guide you through the game.
