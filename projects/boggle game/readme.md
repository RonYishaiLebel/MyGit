This is a boggle game which was made from scratch by my partner and I, written in Python using tk-inter for GUI.
The code is divided tothe following files:
GUI classes, such as score.py, used_words.py etc.
BoggleDisplay.py which is in charge of the display of the game.
BoggleBoard.py, the logical board class.
BoggleGame.py which connects logic part with the GUI part of the code.
boggle.py which is the main script, used for receiving a dictionary of words for the game, and for running the game.
The randomizer was given to us by the school.
