This is a program which receives big data file of all kinds of sequences from the user, analyzes it with Markov Chain  and after this learning process, produces new sequences by itself according to instructions from the user.
The program is written so it will be as generic as possible, so it can handle all kinds of sequences such as Twitter twits or snales and ladders legal moves.
Two classes (snakes_and_ladders.cpp and tweets_generator.cpp are provided for demonstrating the usage of the Markov Chain learning process and the generics.

The project includes:
linked_list files for the linked list class.

markov_chain files for the Markov Chain learning process.

Additional files as described above.
