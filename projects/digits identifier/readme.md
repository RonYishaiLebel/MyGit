This is a program which receives hand written digit photo and determines which dogot is drawn using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
The program determines which digit is the most likely to be written in the photo and calculates the probability for an accurate match.

The project includes:

Matrix files for the Matrix class.

Dense files for Dense class which is a layer in the ANN.

Activation files, for the activation functions which used in the ANN.

MlpNetwork files, for the MlpNetwork class, which organizes the ANN for our particular mission.

Make file for running the program.
